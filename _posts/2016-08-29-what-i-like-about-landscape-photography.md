# What I Like about Landscape Photography

> "In wilderness I sense the miracle of life, and behind it our scientific accomplishments fade to trivia."

Nature can be beautiful, awe-inspiring, terrifying, and violent. Nature teaches us respect and humility. It teaches us that nothing lasts forever and that change is unceasing. Nature is constantly renewing and redefining itself in a cycle of life and death. It is creativity at work and on display for us to share and admire. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c6e210f7-a13c-483b-92fb-4fc715040150.jpg)

Nature gives me a sense of perspective. When I am out photographing a beautiful beach or a majestic mountain, I get a sense of the vast scale of my surroundings and my own insignificance within them. In nature's wide open spaces, my personal struggles, achievements, failures, and successes seem small in comparison. Maybe the problem that has been occupying so much of my time and my thoughts isn't really that big of a problem. My challenge suddenly seems fleeting and insignificant when viewed through the optic of nature's awesome beauty.

Nature reminds me that nothing is permanent and that change is the only constant. Time, weather, and the seasons are constant forces at work on nature. I often return to the same spot to photograph a particular landscape subject. In returning to one of my favorite places, it never ceases to amaze me how much things change. I find it extremely rewarding to notice these changes and capture them in photographs. It's one of the reasons why I don't grow tired of returning to the same location.

Most importantly, nature and landscapes are my source of inspiration. In nature I see creativity at work, constantly renewing and reinventing itself. From the beautiful symmetry of the tiniest leaves to the awesome majesty of the tallest mountains, I see evidence of a greater creative power in action. Landscapes are the canvas on which nature is arranged and composed.

Whether it is beautiful and peaceful or terrifying and chaotic, nature should be observed, explored, shared, protected, and preserved. It is for everyone to be in wonder of and to wander through. It is my main source of inspiration and a resource that is growing scarcer every day. These are the reasons why I am drawn to landscape photography.
